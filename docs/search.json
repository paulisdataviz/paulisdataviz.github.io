    "text": "If you are a Tableau user or developer you may have found yourself in a situation where you need or would like to extract all formulas at once from all calculated fields to later find out there is no simple way to achieve this task. üòü\nI have been in this situation several times, and after giving it some thought, I decided to build my own App and leverage the capabilities of Flexdashboard + Shiny in R.\nThis is the first app I have ever built, and I know it is not perfect, but I learned a lot and had so much fun along the way, but most importantly I know it would be very useful and hope you would think the same.\nI would like to specially thank Matt Dancho who I consider my mentor and from whom I learned what I know about R, all his R Business Science courses are excellent and his support is unconditional. If you are looking to learn R and get into Data Science, I fully recommend taking his R-Track courses.\nWithout further ado let me introduce the:"

    "text": "Tableau Workbook Analyzer App\n\n\n\nHow does the App work?\n\nUpload a .twb file\nWait for results to display (Some files may take longer to return results depending on how big the file is and how many attributes are getting analyzed).\n\nA .twb file contains the Tableau workbook metadata in the form of structured XML tree, and all that was needed was to write some code to extract the relevant elements from the XML tree.\nAs mentioned before, the .twb only contains metadata information about the tableau workbook and it does NOT contain any actual data that was used in the workbook itself.\n\n\n\nExample of metadata inculded in .twb / XML file\n\n\nIf you are wondering how I parsed and extracted the data, below is the sample code I used to extract Data Sources information from .twb file using the library xml2, the main steps in this process are:\n\nIdentify the parent node: ‚Äú//datasource‚Äù\nIdentify the attributes to extract:\n\nExtract data source caption: ‚Äúcaption‚Äù\nExtract data source name: ‚Äúname‚Äù\n\nSave results into a data frame\nDo some data wrangling / cleaning steps (impute NAs and keep unique values) to be able to make sense of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Analysis / information is being returned by the App?\nInitially I was mainly interested in retrieving calculated field formulas, but during the development process I got curious what other pieces of information could be retrieved that would help answer questions such as what fields are used or not used?, are there data sources added to the workbook that may not be used? and more.\nAlso during the final stages of the development process, I reached out to some close friends and members of the Tableau Community asking for feedback and they came back with some awesome ideas such as retrieving Color Palette information. Thank you datafam friends and #VizOfficeHours!\nI broke down the App into three main tabs / sections:\n\n\n\n\n\nI used the same legend throughout the App to represent objects that are used vs not used in dashboards.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is at a high level the information found. Click on each tab to learn more:\n\nWorkbook SummaryColumn & Calculated Fields DetailsFormatting\n\n\nThis section contains a summary of the workbook including:\n\nTableau Workbook Name\nTotal number of fields used vs not used\nData Sources used vs not used\nData Source Tables used vs not used\nWorksheets used vs not used\nDashboards\n\nCollapsible tree that allows to see the flow from:\nData Source -> Dashboard Name -> Worksheet Name -> Field Type - Field Name\n\n\n\nTable with Filters found in worksheets. Table can be exported and it is editable (by double clicking in values).\n\n\n\n\nI would think this section contains the most interesting information‚Ä¶ It has all information about the columns / fields.\nFirst of all, the side panel has various filters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsed in dashboards? - Toggle this filter to update results based on used/ not used fields\nField Type - Select between ‚ÄòCalculated Field‚Äô, ‚ÄòParameter‚Äô and ‚ÄòRaw Variable‚Äô, default is set to display all type of fields\nFields Filter - Select specific fields to review\nCustom information to be added/ removed to/ from field Details table - This filter only applies to Fields Details table\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as information being displayed under this tab, the top section displays:\n\nDistribution of fields by role - Dimension / Measures\nDistribution of fields by data type - String / Integer / date‚Ä¶\nDistribution of fields by type - Raw Variables / Calculated Fields / Parameters\n\n\nThe bottom section contains:\n\nFields Detail table - Contains all relevant information about columns/ fields.\n\nSelect information to be added/ remove to table using filter menu on sidebar\nTable is editable (double click on a value and edit)\nSearch values across tables (This would work like a filter)\nCopy or export table details to CSV or EXCEL\n\n\n\n\nWhat fields are used and how many times - Bar chart:\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least, the formatting tab displays some formatting attributes found in the workbook and they are sorted by most to least used.\n\nFont Names\nFont Sizes\nFont Colors\nMark Colors\nConsolidated list of hex colors used - Similar to other tables in the App, this table can be edited, searched on and copied/ exported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere is the App hosted?\nThe App is hosted at Shinyapps.io.\nShinyapps.io is a platform for hosting Shiny web applications. To learn more about Shinnyapss.io Click here!\nApp can be tested here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would recommend to only use the App hosted online at Shinyapps.io for your personal projects only, and avoid uploading any .twb file that may contain any confidential / work related tableau workbook information.\nIf you are interested in running this app locally in your computer /server, please reach out to me, and I can give you access to the source code (Pre-requisite would be to have R and RStudio installed).\n\n\n\nThe app is hosted under Shinyapps.io Free tier service, and availability of the App is dependent on how many active hours the app has been running in a given month.\n\n\n\nAbout Security and Storage\nA .twb file only contains metadata about the Tableau workbook and it does not contain the actual data used in the workbook itself.\nThe .twb file uploaded to the App is encrypted with HTTPS.\nThe App is not writing the data to a persistent data store, which means the data uploaded to the app is lost once the application goes into iddle state, and to facilitate this I have added buttons across the different tabs to clear the session and close the window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving that said, I would recommend to only use the App hosted online at Shinyapps.io for your personal projects only, and avoid uploading any .twb file that may contain any confidential / work related tableau workbook information.\nIf you are interested in running this app locally in your computer /server, please reach out to me, and I can give you access to the source code (Pre-requisite would be to have R and RStudio installed).\n\n\n\nFor more information about Security and Storage in Shinyapps.io, I have extracted below from Posit and shinnyapps.io websites:\n‚ÄúPosit is a data processor with respect to data processed by Posit Cloud Services, including posit.cloud and shinyapps.io. Posit maintains appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of data processed by Posit Cloud Services. All communication between customers and Posit Cloud Services is encrypted with HTTPS. Within Posit Cloud Services, data at-rest is also encrypted.‚Äù read more here\n‚ÄúEach application deployed to shinyapps.io creates storage in its own private file system when the application starts to run. The application only has access to the data that was uploaded with the application at the time of deployment.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe storage will be persistent while the application is in the Running state. After the idle timeout is reached, the application will be put into a Sleeping state, and any changes to the file system will be lost.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIf your shiny application collects information that you would like to have persisted, you will need to write the data to a persistent data store (e.g., databases, Dropbox, Google Sheets, S3 etc.)‚Äù shinyapps.io documentation\n\n\n\nReady to test App, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would recommend to only use the App hosted online at Shinyapps.io for your personal projects only, and avoid uploading any .twb file that may contain any confidential / work related tableau workbook information.\nIf you are interested in running this app locally in your computer /server, please reach out to me, and I can give you access to the source code (Pre-requisite would be to have R and RStudio installed)."
