IIt's been some time since I last participated in a Data Visualization Community Challenge. Inspired by several posts from my #datafam peers, I've decided to take on this week's Du Bois Visualization Challenge.

## What is the Du Bois Visualization Challenge?

-   It is a community project hosted by the Data Visualization Society, with the primary goal of recreating the visualizations from 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools.

-   [Read the details here](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/blob/master/challenge/2024/README.md)

## Week 2 Challenge - "Slaves and Free Negroes" Portrait (Original Plate 12)

-   This week's challenge involves recreating the original Plate 12: "Slaves and Free Negroes" portrait. See the original portrait below:

## Recreating the visualization in three different BI Tools

#### Data

-   The data consisted of three numeric fields: **Year**, **Slave**, **Free**

-   To facilitate the visualization process it is best to unpivot / re-shape the data to display: **Year**, **Attribute**, V**alue**
