IIt's been some time since I last participated in a Data Visualization Community Challenge. Inspired by several posts from my #datafam peers, I've decided to take on this week's Du Bois Visualization Challenge.

## What is the Du Bois Visualization Challenge?

-   It is a community project hosted by the Data Visualization Society

-   ["The goal is to celebrate the data visualization legacy of W.E.B Du Bois by recreating the visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools".](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/blob/master/challenge/2024/README.md)

## Week 2 Challenge - "Slaves and Free Negroes" Portrait (Original Plate 12)

-   This weeks challenge consist in recreating the Original Plate 12: Slaves and Free Negroes Portrait, see Original Portrait below:
